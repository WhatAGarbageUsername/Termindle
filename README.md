A Wordle Clone made Using the Curses Python Library

- Shows old guesses
- Shows which Characters within the Guess are Correct
- Tracker for Number of Guesses
- Win / Loss screen that tells you what the correct word was

TO (Maybe) DO:
- show a keyboard, what keys have been sent
- more updating of design, centering guesses to middle of screen, showing number of guesses at end



I've grown fond of TUI applications and have wanted to make one for a bit now, i think this was a good, well-executed first attempt.
